  '<p>Welcome to Blush! We are so happy you’re here.</p>

<p>Let’s get the boring details outta the way now.</p>

<p>First, before you do anything else, <span style="font-weight: bold;">make sure you fill out your profile <span style="text-decoration: underline;">completely</span>. The profile questions are located under "My Account.”</span></p>

<p>Please do this ASAP so we can match you with your ideal coach. Without the *complete* information, we can’t pair you with your soon-to-be favorite person, so please do that at your earliest convenience.</p>

<p>Once we have made the match, we will alert you via email. Don\'t worry, this shouldn\'t take more than a few hours <em>if your profile is complete.</em>...that is unless you\'re filling out this information at midnight. If that\'s the case, go to bed, and we\'ll get to it as soon as we have coffee in our system!</p>

<p>After you are officially matched with a coach, you may login and begin booking sessions or journals, whichever you prefer (or purchased).</p>

<p>Here’s the skinny:</p>
<h3 style="font-weight: bold;"><em>Video Sessions (2 credits)</em></h3>
<ol>
  <li>Click <em>“+video session”</em> in your Dashboard and select a time that works for you. Your coach’s availability will show up for each date you select.</li>
  <li>Always use a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Chrome browser</span>on your desktop. Firefox is a decent option, too. And, if you have an Android tablet or phone, you can use Blush anywhere.</li>
  <li>Sessions are thirty minutes long. For a full hour, simply schedule back to back.</li>
  <li>Sessions need to be scheduled, rescheduled, or canceled within <span style="font-weight: bold;">24 hours</span>.</li>
  <li>All session times and appointments reflect <em>your</em> selected time zone. If traveling/moving, you can change your timezone under your Account Information.</li>
</ol>
<h3 style="font-weight: bold;"><em>Journals (1 credit)</em></h3>
<ol>
  <li>Click <em>"+blush journal"</em> in your Dashboard to create a new entry</li>
  <li>Write as much as you would like - there is no limit. Just know your coach can only read and respond to so much, so sometimes it’s best to break up your journals into smaller journals for more detailed responses. </li>
  <li>You can save a draft as you work. Just remember to submit it when you are finished!</li>
  <li>Your coach will respond within 48 hours. You will receive an email notification when she has responded!</li>
</ol>
<p>If you run out of credits at any time, you can add more by going to your Dashboard and clicking "add credits." (Remember, you need one credit for a journal entry and two credits for a video session).</p>
<p>If you haven\'t joined a membership yet, you can do so in your Account Information under the <em>"Account Type"</em>tab.</p>
<p>For any questions, please reach out to us at <a href="mailto:accounts@joinblush.com">accounts@joinblush.com</a>.</p>

<p>Blush you!</p>';
