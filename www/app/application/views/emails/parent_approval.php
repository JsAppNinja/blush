      Welcome! Thank you for joining Blush!
  </p>
  <p>As a sponsor of a Blush Girl, we would like to inform you about our policies and procedures here at Blush. Don\'t worry, this won\'t take too long, we just want to make sure everyone is involved!</p>
  <p>Once you\'ve reviewed our policies below, click the following confirmation link to activate your child\'s Blush Account.  They will not be able to use their account until this link is clicked.</p>
  <p style="margin-bottom:10px;padding:8px;text-shadow: 0 1px 0 #FFFFFF;border-radius:4px;background:#FCF8E3;color: #8A6D3B; border:1px #FCF8E3 solid !important">

    <li>Blush offers coaching services only, and does not offer mental health psychotherapy. Although your coach may be licensed to practice mental health counseling, they are not practicing psychotherapy through Blush. Remember—you\'re not crazy, and we aren\'t psychotherapists.</li>
    <li>Blush is for girls who are currently 13 years or older. Girls under the age of 18 must have an adult sponsor.</li>
    <li>Blush recommends coaching for a minimum of six weeks (one session each week), and ideally at least 12 weeks. If you want your girl to reap the full benefits of what coaching can do, encourage her to stick around. Plus, we would be sad to see her go!</li>
    <li>Credits will be purchased through the Blush website in order to schedule sessions or purchase Blush Journal entries. Payment is secured via credit or debit cards. Credits do not expire (yay!)</li>
    <li>After signing up for Blush, we personally match your teen with a coach. This is not automated; we have real live human beings working hard to make sure they execute the perfect match! Remember that it can take time for your girl and our coach to cultivate a rock solid relationship, so if there isn\'t a connection in the beginning, encourage her to be patient. However, if she knows in her heart of hearts this is NOT working for her...</li>
    <li>Blush will match your girl with another coach for future sessions if you truly feel there is not a great connection with her original coach. Please handle this by emailing <a href="mailto:info@joinblush.com">info@joinblush.com</a> and we can begin that process!</li>
    <li>Blush coaching works best with no distractions! Our coaches won\'t be videoconferencing your teen from a Beyoncé concert, and we trust that she will not do the same! Remember, we cannot ensure confidentiality if your girl chooses to conduct her session in a public space.  Have her select an environment that is convenient and familiar so she can relax, let it out, and start feeling better!</li>
    <li>Each online videoconference session is 50-60 minutes long depending on the nature of the session. Blush does not encourage abrupt endings to sessions, so we leave a 10-minute window to wrap up any pressing conversation. But your busy teenager should not worry about blocking off half of her day; your sessions will take no longer than one hour.</li>
    <li>Both your Blush girl and her coach agree to show up for the scheduled time of the videoconferencing session. Cancellations will be accepted up to 24 hours before the scheduled session. If there is a cancellation after 24 hours, the credits will be forfeited, and that would be sad. Blush will deal with emergencies as they arise!</li>
    <li>If your Blush girl is more than 10 minutes late for a session, that is considered a "no-show" and will result in forfeited credits. Eeeeek! We don\'t want that! So encourage her to be on time!</li>
    <li>If your teen does not show up for your scheduled session twice without notification during the course of your Blush coaching, her coach will evaluate whether coaching is the right fit for her at this time. If an emergency happens, just send us an email! We don\'t bite, we blush!</li>
    <li>Your girl and her coach each have the right to terminate the coaching relationship at any time. We trust you know what is best for your teen!</li>
    <li>You and your teen are responsible for your own choices. Any and all comments made by the Blush coach are for the betterment of the coaching experience and to help achieve your teen\'s personal goals.</li>
    <li>All communication between the you, your teen, and her coach will take place via the Blush website to ensure confidentiality and privacy.</li>
    <li>Your teen\'s coach will maintain to the extent of the state\'s governing laws where your teen resides and where the coach resides. Typical exceptions to confidentiality include:
        <ol>
            <li>Written permission of the client</li>
            <li>Subpoena or court order</li>
            <li>Cause to believe there has been or may be abuse or neglect of a minor or an elderly or disabled person</li>
            <li>Threat of immediate harm or danger to the client or another individual</li>
        </ol>
    <li>Because your girl is under the age of 18, we need a parent or legal guardian\'s acknowledgement, understanding, and agreement for her to receive coaching. With that being said...</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Hi Mom! Hi Dad!</h3>
  <p>Thanks for reading this far into the email; we know we can be a bit boring and a bit bossy. The good news is, we are almost done! Below is some information we like to share with you before getting started. Read carefully, and then at the bottom of this email there will be a link where you can confirm that you have read, understand, and agree to Blush\'s policies and procedures. Thank you and Blush you!</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Sometimes it gets worse before it gets better. We know that there is conflict in every household, and that tension can cause a lot of strain and uncomfortable moments. Blush wants to make that better. However, when issues are brought to the surface, things can look a lot worse. Be patient! In order to make sustainable changes, things might not look so pretty in the beginning. If you have any concerns or get nervous about the process, feel free to contact your girls\' coach to ask a few questions, or talk to us and your girl about scheduling your own session.</li>
    <li>We want coaching to be the best it can be for your girl. Because of that, we do not want to threaten the trust or foundation that our coaches have created with her. Your girl deserves confidentiality and respect while she works through personal issues. This is why Blush keeps your girl\'s records and sessions private. She needs to be able to trust her coach so she can be completely open and honest about her life\'s happenings and what she wishes to change. If we can achieve that level of safety, then we are miles closer to success!</li>
    <li>If you are a parent that is interested in being involved in the coaching process, that makes us really happy! Please let your girl and her coach know as soon as possible! Teens should always be aware that there is communication between her coach and her family. Blush typically recommends scheduling a session individually or with your girl earlier in the process, for instance the first or second session, so that everyone can be involved as early as possible.  From then on out, it is typical for parents to engage every five or six sessions, whether that is in the form of individual or joint sessions. However, there is no formula for involvement! Please remind your girl that there is no need to worry about her privacy. She will continue to have a strong relationship with her coach regardless of who becomes involved. Not only will this make her feel safe, but it will also show her that you respect her and the coaching process.</li>
    <li>Given the information above, you probably realize by now that you and your girl cannot share an account due to confidentiality. However, it is SUPER easy to create your own account as a parent! Plus, credits do not expire! That means you can buy in bulk or pay per session, whatever is easiest for you. And, you can enjoy the cathartic Blush Journal. Remember, with your teen\'s permission, you can always join in on her sessions without having your own account. We just like to give the option for individual sessions in case you want to blush up on being a great parent to your teen!</li>
